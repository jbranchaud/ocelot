# Ocelot v0.1.0

a versioning system commit annotation DSL

By [Josh Branchaud](http://joshbranchaud.com) and Corey Jergensen

This spec is unstable and will likely change significantly until 1.0 is
reached.

## Objectives

Ocelot aims to be a simple and intuitive domain-specific language for
annotating commits that is both human and machine writable and readable. It
aims to easly map to both
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
and [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) so as to be as familiar as possible.
Ocelet will make it easier to encode information in a standard commit
message that details the parts of the commit message that are associated
with particular files as well as what file artifacts in a commit are related
to one another and how.
